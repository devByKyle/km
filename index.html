                <p> Hi, I'm Kyle McDonald. I build things for real time systems.
                    I'm a senior software engineer based in Western Massachusetts, specializing in
                    writing and testing low-level code. I am a highly motivated and detail oriented
                    individual who develops excellent working relationships with team members.
                    I possess a strong aptitude for leadership and problem solving
                    during team-based work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a self described geek, and as such I enjoy tinkering and keeping up with
                    the latest technology. I consider myself a sports enthusiast, both watching
                    and playing. When I'm not in front of a screen, I often find myself on runs,
                    people watching or enjoying nature's beauty.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> Research with TinyOS, an open source embedded operating
                        system designed for low-powered wireless embedded sensor systems. TinyOS features a
                        component-based architecture which enabled rapid innovation and implementation,
                        while minimizing code size required by the severe memory constraints inherent in sensor
                        networks. Using Tiny OS Simulator, strengths and weaknesses were identified
                        through network packet injection and scheduling.
                    </li>
                    <li> People-to-People. This was a small team project using the MEAN solution stack
                        (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js).This application was based on the
                        popular card game Apples to Apples. Led a group of two other individuals with
                        back-end development workflow. Responsible for cross-team communication with
                        the front-end team, often working with them on customization of cards and
                        categories as well as the creation of a leader board based on the users location.
                    </li>
                    <li> Creation of a mock online banking website. A part of a two person team in which we created an
                        online banking website which included user logins, transaction reports, user login
                        authentication, and other built in securities to prevent users from accessing others
                        information. This project was written in C# for the front-end, with Oracle's SQL for
                        the back-end.
